# SocialDistance

This sample uses a simple crowd simulation to show how Horde3D can
be used to render environments and a plenty of animated models.
The demo supports forward and deferred rendering which can be
selected by modifying the pipeline_SocialDistance.xml file.

## Input

 * Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around.
 * Hold down LSHIFT to move faster.
 * Space freezes the scene, hitting space two times freezes the camera as well.
 * F1 HELP
 * F3 switches between forward, hdr and deferred shading.
 * F6 toggles frame stats display.
 * F7 toggles debug view.
 * F8 toggles wireframe mode.
 * F11 sets fullscreen mode.
 * ESC quits the application.
